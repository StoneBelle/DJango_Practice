# DJANGO
# A Django PROJECT is the website
# A Django APP are sub components of the website 
    # typically organized by functionality
    # create a app using the django admin tool

# DJANGO ADMIN TOOL 
# In the cmd line run the following code to set up your directory
# django-admin startproject [PROJECTNAME]

# The above line will create a directory containing:
# project_name (which serves as the root directory)
    # project_name (folder w py files)
        # __init__.py
        # settings.py
        # urls.py
        # asgi.py
        # wsgi.py
    # manage.py 

# manage.py has overlap with django-admin
# it contains cmd line utlities that allow you to interact w django
# i.e. it helps you manage your project
