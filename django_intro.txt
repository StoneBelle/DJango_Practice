# DJANGO
# makes web dev easier by leveraging python
# compatible with python libraries and has many built-in py-functionalities
# scalable, regularly updated, and secure 

# DJANGO PROJECT 
    # is the website project itself
    # in the cmd line run the following code to set up your directory:
    # django-admin startproject [PROJECTNAME]

    # The above line will create a directory containing:
    # project_name (which serves as the root directory)
        # project_name (folder w py files)
            # __init__.py
            # settings.py
            # urls.py
            # asgi.py
            # wsgi.py
        # manage.py 

# DJANGO APPLICATION 
    # sub components of the website 
    # used for the organization/separation of key functionalities
    # i.e. apps. act like "folders"

    # Create a Django app. use:
        # python manage.py startapp [APPNAME]
        
    # Run app. use: 
        # python manage.py runserver

# manage.py has overlap with django-admin
# it contains cmd line utlities that allow you to interact w django
    # i.e. it helps you manage your project
